## Boolean Algebra Laws

| Law Name | `OR` Identity | `AND` Identity |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------|
| Law of Double Complement | $\overline{\overline{A}}$ | $\overline{\overline{A}}$ |
| Idempotent Law | $A + A = A$ | $AA = A$ |
| Identity Law | $A + 0 = A$ | $A1 = A$ |
| Domination Law | $A + 1 = 1$ | $A0 = 0$ |
| Commutative Law | $A + B = B + A$ | $AB = BA$ |
| Associative Law | $A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C$ | $A(BC) = (AB)C$ |
| Distributive Law | $A + BC = (A + B)(A + C)$ | $A(B + C) = AB + AC$ |
| De Morgan's Law | $(\overline{A + B}) = \bar{A}\bar{B}$ | $(\overline{AB}) = \bar{A} + \bar{B}$ |
| Absorption Law | $A + AB = A$ | $A(A + B) = A$ |
| Unit property | $A + \bar{A} = 1$ | &nbsp; |
| Zero property | &nbsp; | $A\bar{A} = 0$ |

> [!TIP]
> The [Boolean Algebra Simplifier](https://www.boolean-algebra.com/) is an awesome website to check your work and solutions. Its [learn](https://www.boolean-algebra.com/learn) tab is a learning resource hub about Boolean Algebra.

## Karnaugh-maps

> [!NOTE]
> **What is a Karnaugh Map?**
> - Graphical method of simplifying Boolean expressions
> - Allows for easier pattern recognition
> - Good for circuit designs with up to four variables

> a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always form the largest possible groups (must be $2^{n}$ in size = 1, 2, 4, 8...)<br />
> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construct the smallest possible number of groups provided that rule c) is obeyed<br />
> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the square that contains a 1, must be included in at least one group<br />
> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squares should not be included in more than on group unless the inclusion of a square in more than one group enables a small group to be replaced in a larger one

1. Find the minterms through the truth table, minterms are from each `1` in `Y`.
2. Write out the Boolean expression in Sum of Product (SoP) form. The SoP is a Boolean expression containing all minterms.
3. Add the `1`'s to the appropriate place(s) in the Karnaugh map.
