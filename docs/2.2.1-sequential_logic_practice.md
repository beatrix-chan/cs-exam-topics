# Sequential Logic &mdash; Practice Question

## Elevator Floor Access System

An elevator system uses a 3-digit binary code to grant access to a restricted floor.<br />
The correct access code is the binary sequence '`1` `1` `0`'.<br />
The system processes one bit at a time and resets if the sequence is entered incorrectly.

The system uses **four states** $S_{0}$ &ndash; $S_{3}$, where:
- $S_{0}$ is the idle state (no correct bits entered)
- $S_{1}$ is one correct idle entered (`1`)
- $S_{2}$ is two correct bits entered (`1` `1`)
- $S_{3}$ is the final state (`1` `1` `0`) &mdash; access granted

<br />

- **Input $R$**: Serial input of the access code (one bit at a time)
- **Output $G$**: Indicates whether access is granted ($G = 1$) or denied ($G = 0$)

### Your Task:
1. Draw a **state transition diagram** for the system described above.
2. Create a **state transition table** showing current state, next state and input, and output.
3. Use **Karnaugh maps** or **Boolean Algebra** to simplify the logic equations for $D_{1}$ &ndash; $D_{0}$ and $G$.
4. Draw the **logic circuit diagram** based on your simplified equations.
5. Simplify your circuit to use `NAND` gate only.
